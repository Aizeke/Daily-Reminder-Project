                Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department
                stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in
                bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm
                milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems
                sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was
                told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to
                live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing,
                that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what
                brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone. -->
